My name is Sri Harsha. I'm a Security Engineer/Pentester, with a focus on Cloud Platforms and Kubernetes.

I ❤️ Linux and use it as both my personal and professional desktop environment (Obligatory, I use arch btw!). My main editor is Neovim. You can find my dotfiles [here](https://github.com/DerpGusta/dotfiles) 

If you are interested in my work-experience/hiring me, you can find my resume [here](/resume.pdf)
